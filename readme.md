# Assessment Table Project

## Overview

This project provides a single-page application for assessing different options based on various criteria. It allows you to add and remove both options and criteria, edit their names, and automatically calculates and displays maximum values for each criterion as well as a coefficient based on the option values and weights for each row.

## Features

- **Add New Criteria**: You can dynamically add new rows to the table to represent different criteria.
- **Add New Options**: You can dynamically add new columns to the table to represent different options.
- **Edit Names**: The names for both options and criteria are editable.
- **Delete Specific Criteria or Options**: Each criterion and option has a delete button for removal.
- **Maximum Value Display**: Each row includes a cell that displays the maximum value among the options for that criterion.
- **Coefficient Calculation**: Each option has a corresponding "Coef" column, which is calculated based on the maximum value in the row and the weight of the row.
